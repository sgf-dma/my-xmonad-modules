-- $main
--
-- This module provides monad on top of Query monad providing additional
-- information about new window:
--
--  - workspace, where new window will appear;
--  - focused window on workspace, where new window will appear;
--  - current workspace;
--
-- And two properties in extensible state:
--
--  - is focus lock enabled? Focus lock instructs all library's 'FocusHook'
--  functions to not move focus.
--  - is new window @_NET_ACTIVE_WINDOW@ activated? It is not really new in
--  that case, but i may work with it in the same way.
--
-- Lifting operations for standard 'ManageHook' EDSL combinators into
-- 'FocusQuery' monad allowing to run these combinators on focused window and
-- common actions for keeping focus and\/or workspace, switching focus and\/or
-- workspace are also provided.
--
-- __/WARNING!/__ 'activateEventHook' (which handles window activation) will
-- use 'manageHook' for handling activated window. That means, actions, which
-- you don't want to happen on activated windows, should be guarded by
--
-- > not <$> activated
--
-- predicate. This requires to lift them into 'FocusHook' and then convert
-- back into 'ManageHook' using 'manageFocus'.
--
-- __/WARNING!/__ Since this module enables and handles window activation on
-- its own, it is /not/ compatible with 'XMonad.Hooks.EwmhDesktops.ewmh'
-- function from 'XMonad.Hooks.EwmhDesktops' module. Well, it will compile and
-- work, but window activation handling according to 'FocusHook' won't work,
-- because 'XMonad.Hooks.EwmhDesktops.ewmh' handler will overwrite it.
--
-- I may define 'FocusHook' like:
--
-- >    activateFocusHook :: FocusHook
-- >    activateFocusHook = composeAll
-- >            -- If 'gmrun' is focused on workspace, on which
-- >            -- activated window is, keep focus unchanged. But i
-- >            -- may still switch workspace.
-- >            [ focused (className =? "Gmrun")
-- >                            --> keepFocus
-- >            -- Default behavior for activated windows: switch
-- >            -- workspace and focus.
-- >            , return True   --> switchWorkspace <+> switchFocus
-- >            ]
-- >
-- >    newFocusHook :: FocusHook
-- >    newFocusHook      = composeOne
-- >            -- Always switch focus to 'gmrun'.
-- >            [ new (className =? "Gmrun")        -?> switchFocus
-- >            -- And always keep focus on 'gmrun'. Note, that
-- >            -- another 'gmrun' will steal focus from already
-- >            -- running one.
-- >            , focused (className =? "Gmrun")    -?> keepFocus
-- >            -- If firefox dialog prompt (e.g. master password
-- >            -- prompt) is focused on current workspace and new
-- >            -- window appears here too, keep focus unchanged
-- >            -- (note, used predicates: @newOnCur <&&> focused@ is
-- >            -- the same as @newOnCur <&&> focusedCur@, but is
-- >            -- /not/ the same as just 'focusedCur' )
-- >            , newOnCur <&&> focused
-- >                ((className =? "Iceweasel" <||> className =? "Firefox") <&&> isDialog)
-- >                                                -?> keepFocus
-- >            -- Default behavior for new windows: switch focus.
-- >            , return True                       -?> switchFocus
-- >            ]
--
-- And then use it (paste definition of 'FocusHook' above there too) like:
--
-- >    import XMonad
-- >
-- >    import XMonad.Hooks.ManageHelpers hiding ((-?>), composeOne)
-- >    import Sgf.XMonad.Hooks.Focus
-- >
-- >    main :: IO ()
-- >    main = do
-- >            let xcf = handleFocusQuery (Just (0, xK_v)) (composeOne
-- >                            [ activated -?> activateFocusHook
-- >                            , Just <$> newFocusHook
-- >                            ])
-- >                        $ def
-- >            xmonad xcf
-- >
-- >    composeOne :: (Monoid a, Monad m) => [m (Maybe a)] -> m a
-- >    composeOne [] = return mempty
-- >    composeOne (mx : xs) = do
-- >        x <- mx
-- >        case x of
-- >          Just y  -> return y
-- >          Nothing -> composeOne xs
-- >
-- >    infixr 0 -?>
-- >    (-?>) :: Monad m => m Bool -> m a -> m (Maybe a)
-- >    (-?>) mb mx     = do
-- >        b <- mb
-- >        if b
-- >          then Just <$> mx
-- >          else return Nothing
--
--
-- Note:
--
--  - /mod+v/ key toggles focus lock (when enabled, focus will not be switched
--  to new window). I don't need to specify @modMask@ in lock focus key
--  definition, because 'handleFocusQuery' will add it automatically.
--  - 'handleFocusQuery' will enable window activation.
--  - I need more generic 'XMonad.Hooks.ManageHelpers.-?>' and
--  'XMonad.Hooks.ManageHelpers.composeOne', than in the
--  'XMonad.Hooks.ManageHelpers'.
--  - The order, when constructing final 'FocusHook' in 'handleFocusQuery'
--  call: 'FocusHook' without 'activated' predicate will match to activated
--  windows too, thus i should place it after one with 'activated' (so the
--  latter will have a chance to handle activated window first).
--
--
-- And more technical notes:
--
--  - 'FocusHook' will run /many/ times, so it usually should not keep state
--  or save results. Precisely, it may do anything, but it must be idempotent
--  to operate properly.
--  - 'FocusHook' will see new window at workspace, where functions on the
--  /right/ from 'handleFocusQuery' in 'ManageHook' monoid place it.  In other
--  words, in @(Endo WindowSet)@ monoid i may see changes only from functions
--  applied /before/ (more to the right in function composition). Thus, it's
--  better to apply 'handleFocusQuery' the last.
--  - 'FocusHook' functions won't see window shift to another workspace made
--  by function from 'FocusHook' itself: new window workspace is determined
--  /before/ running 'FocusHook' and even if later one of 'FocusHook'
--  functions moves window to another workspace, predicates ('focused',
--  'newOn', etc) will still think new window is at workspace it was before.
--  This can be worked around by splitting 'FocusHook' into several different
--  values and evaluating each one separately, like:
--
--      > (FH2 -- manageFocus --> MH2) <+> (FH1 -- manageFocus --> MH1) <+> ..
--
--      E.g.
--
--      > manageFocus FH2 <+> manageFocus FH1 <+> ..
--
--      now @FH2@ will see window shift made by @FH1@.
--
--  - I may define my own 'handleFocusQuery', all required functions are
--  exported. I may redefine handling of activated windows too, but note:
--  'handleEventHook' handling window activation should correctly set\/unset
--  'NetActivated' in extensible state, like 'activateEventHook' does, and
--  usually there should be only one 'handleEventHook' processing activated
--  windows.
--
-- Another interesting example is moving all activated windows to current
-- workspace by default, and applying 'FocusHook' after:
--

--
-- Note here:
--
--  - i keep focus, when activated window appears on current workspace, in
--  this example.
--  - when @activated -?> (newOnCur --> keepFocus)@ runs, activated window
--  will be /already/ on current workspace, thus, if i do not want to move
--  some activated windows, i should filter them out in @activateOnCurrentWs@
--  FocusHook.
